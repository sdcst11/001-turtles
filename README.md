## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #2b Working with Variables (Total Marks 7)

Objectives:
* to perform math operations with numerical value variables and then print the results

You will be using the mathematical operators listed:
```
+ addition. can concatenate (join) 2 strings
- subtraction. 
* multiplication. an integer can also multiply by a string
/ division.  all answers are converted to floats even if you do integer / integer
** exponents
% modulus (shows the remainder when two numbers are divided)
```

Note:  When a math operation involves a float and an int, the evaluated expression will automatically be converted to a float.

Perform the operations listed and then display the output using the print() command.  No other output is required other than the numerical result.

**Note that in all of these programs, you MUST store your answer in a variable called "answer"**

##### Task 1
Open the assignment called a1.py
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display the sum of the two numbers (use addition)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 2
Open the assignment called a2.py
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display the difference of the two numbers (use subtraction)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 3
Copy the contents of a2.py and create a new file called a3.py that has the same content.
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display only the product of the two numbers (use multiplication)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 4
Copy the contents of a2.py and create a new file called a4.py that has the same content.
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display only the quotient of the two numbers (use division)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 5
Copy the contents of a2.py and create a new file called a5.py that has the same content.
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display only the modulus of the two numbers (use %)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 6
Copy the contents of a2.py and create a new file called a6.py that has the same content.
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display only the answer of x to the power of y.
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

1 mark will be given for having the correct value stored into the variable "answer"

##### Task 7
Read through the file **example1.py** for information on using the "round()" command.
* Open the file called a7.py
* The program has a variable called F that will store a float value for the temperature in degrees Fahreneight
* Set F to a value of 62.5
* Do a calculation that converts the temperature to degrees C and stores it in a variable called C
* Round the temperature in C to 1 decimal place and print the result

##### Task 8
Read through the file **example2.py** and **example3.py** for information on using the math module.
Calculate the length of a hypotenuse given 2 variables
Set the value of a to 5
Set the value of b to 8

Determine the length of the hypotenuse and store it into a variable called c
print the value of c

You may use either the ** operator or math.pow(x,y) for your exponents
You may use either math.sqrt(x) or the exponent to the power of 0.5 for your square root
